# Stellarity Enlightened (UNOFFICIAL)
Stellarity Enlightened is a mod version of the total rehaul of The End including biome and structure overhauls, new items, weapons, mechanics, mobs and more. 

Explore new end cities, fight enhanced ender dragons, fish in the void, and explore new biomes and structures, now available as a Fabric mod!

The original version you can find as [Stellarity Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/stellarity/versions). 

However, due to constant issues with forge and absolutely no progress being made, 
I have decided to take a stab by dropping the (Neo)Forge loader. Hence this is why this is an unofficial version.

## ⚠️ Here is what this means:
- This mod is **UNOFFICIAL** until explicitly approved by kohara to be official.
- This project and all mod distribution pages may be swapped out and transferred to kohara's dev team if multiloader support stablizes and kohara approved
- This mod does **NOT** have a ETA for when it will be finished
- Kohara is **NOT** involved in the development of this mod until further notice, so please don't bother him about it
- There is no guarantee for stability or compatibility with other mods
- This is a purely hobby project, and the creator, she has college and other responsibilities, so please don't bother her too much about stuff
